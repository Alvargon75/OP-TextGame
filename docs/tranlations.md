# Translations

If you want to translate, please create an *issue* with the label *translations* and fill it like this:  

    Language: French
    Country: Belgium
    Language Code: fr-BE
    Estimated Release Date: 30/11/2016

Then begin translating the game, fork the file `data/locale/template.yaml` and fill it (according to the style guide available at `docs/yaml-style.md` ). You can look in `data/locale/es-ES.yaml` or `data/locale/en-US.yaml` and translate it from there.

When you are finished, send a *Pull request* with the new **YAML** file, name it like the country code. If it is *fr-BE* name the file `fr-BE.yaml`.
